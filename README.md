Face Counting Project
**Overview**
This project aims to develop a system that can accurately count the number of faces present in a given image or through a webcam. The key features include face detection, face counting, drawing bounding boxes around detected faces, and optionally displaying confidence scores. The project also supports batch-processing of multiple images and provides performance metrics for evaluation.
**Project Structure**
The project is organized into the following directories and files:
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
train/: Training images.
test/: Testing images.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model development.
src/: Source code for reusable functions and scripts.
face_detector.py: Script for face detection and counting.
utils.py: Utility functions for image processing and visualization.
results/: Output files, visualizations, and results.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.
README.md: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
**Dependencies**
The following libraries are required for this project:
OpenCV: For reading images, detecting faces, and drawing bounding boxes.
NumPy: For handling arrays and numerical operations.
Matplotlib (optional): For displaying images inside notebooks.
dlib (optional): For more accurate face detection.
MTCNN (optional): For using a pre-trained deep learning face detector.
TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional): If using deep learning models like YOLO, SSD, etc.
Streamlit / Gradio (optional): For creating a web app for uploading images and showing results.
scikit-learn (optional): For calculating performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall).
